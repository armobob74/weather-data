Is there a correlation between precipitation and temperature?
Somebody told me that rainy days are warmer because the clouds act as insulation.
Looking at historical weather data, we see that on average, that's not true.
If anything, there's a negative correlation (-0.23) between daily maximum temperature and precipitation,
meaning that rainy days are colder.
